                  for short. Our choice in propellants for Borealis was
                  initially informed by our total inexperience at the time and
                  budget limitations. Although ethanol and nitrous oxide have
                  significant performance disadvantages, they are{" "}
                  <Text {...b1Style}>
                    some of the safest propellants to handle
                  </Text>{" "}
                  (by the standards of rocketry). Our top priority is the safety
                  of our members, which was the primary rationale behind our
                  propellant choice. After the procedural and hands-on
                  experience gained through a number of cold-flow and hot-fire
                  tests with both inert and live propellants, we are confident
                  in seeking approval for more conventional propellant
                  combinations like Kerolox.

                  During the research phase of our engine design, we realized
                  that a relatively miniscule amount of research has been
                  published on ethanol and nitrous oxide rocket engines.
                  Although this resulted in less references to draw upon, it
                  also represented{" "}

                  This is because combustion temperature is only dependent on

                  first hot-fire test. As Borealis is a static instrumentation
                  engine, the weight penalty of an external cooling system was
                  not a factor for us. Our thin chamber walls will also allow us

                  From the beginning, our coolant system was also designed to
